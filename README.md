## Setting up the environment

### Dependencies

1. Install [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) on your system.
2. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your system.
3. Make sure that port 80 of your laptop/desktop does not have a running service.
4. Android/iOS phone would be required for mobile application testing.

### Setting up the server

1. Clone the repository on your system (Laptop/Desktop)
`git clone https://github.com/lucideus-repo/UnSAFE_Bank.git`
2. Navigate to the UnSAFE_Bank/Backend directory
`cd UnSAFE_Bank/Backend`
3. Start docker service (if not running)
`sudo service docker start`
4. Start the containers
`docker-compose up -d`

### Installing iOS Application

1. Download and install the [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/) on your system.
2. Connect your iPhone to the system and open Cydia Impactor.
3. Navigate to the **/iOS** directory.
4. Drag and drop the **UnSAFE Bank.ipa** file on Cydia Impactor.
5. Follow the Cydia Impactor process to complete the installation.
6. Trust the developer profile (if required) and your application would be ready to use.

**Note:** You can always use [other methods](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/ios-testing-guide/0x06b-basic-security-testing#installing-apps) to install the iOS application as per your convenience.

### Test Connectivity Status (iOS Application)

1. Make sure your iPhone and the server machine are connected to the same network.
2. Check your server's IP address (`ifconfig` or `ipconfig`) and the port (Default port is 80).
3. Open the iOS Application and provide the connection strings on the top right corner to connect to the backend.
4. If there is no error message on your iPhone then "You are connected successfully".
5. If there is an error, make sure your backend is running successfully or you have provided the valid IP address/port.

### Test Connectivity Status (Web Application)

1. Make sure that you are either using the same machine as the server or the server machine is running on a machine on the same local network.
2. Note down the port number of your web application (APP_PORT). Default port is 3000.
3. Check your server's IP address (`ifconfig` or `ipconfig`) and the port (Default port is 80).
4. On any browser, navigate to http://<SERVER_IP>:<APP_PORT> and check if you can land at the login page.
5. Click on `Test Connection?` and enter the <SERVER_IP> and <SERVER_PORT>.
6. Ensure that the application shows a message `Connection Established`.



### Login Credentials

Customer ID and password is required to login into the application. You can always sign up as a new user in the application.

On successful sign up:

1. You will be provided with your Customer ID corresponding to your account. Always note your Customer ID and keep it SAFE for further usage.
2. Your dummy PII and account information would be created automatically.
3. Default beneficiaries would be added in your account.
4. Virtual money would be added in your account ranging from 1 to 10 lakh.

### Troubleshooting
Problem 1: Docker containers fail to build on the first attempt.

Problem 2: Internet connection goes away while the docker containers are building up. 

Problem 3: You end up inserting junk data or deleting essential data from the database.

> Solution: run the command `docker-compose up -d --build` to build the docker containers fresh.

Problem 4: Error message `listen tcp 0.0.0.0:80: bind: address already in use`.

Problem 5: Error message `listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3000: bind: address already in use`.

> Solution: Check that another service that uses port 80 such as Apache or IIS is down.

Problem 6: Navigating to http://<SERVER_IP>:<SERVER_PORT> gives a mesage `Service Unavailable`. 

> Solution: Wait for 20 to 30 seconds for the services to completely start up.

Problem 7: Web application shows the message `Backend server is unrespensive`.

> Solution 1: Follow the steps mentioned to [check the connectivity status](https://github.com/lucideus-repo/UnSAFE_Bank/blob/master/README.md#test-connectivity-status-web-application) and navigate to http://<SERVER_URL>:<SERVER_PORT>/api. Check if you can get the message `Welcome to UnSAFE Bank`.
